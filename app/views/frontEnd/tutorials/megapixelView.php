            <p>This part isn't really a tutorial but as an amateur photographer I feel its information that's necessary to get out to the picture taking public.  Most camera manufactures and nowadays cell phone manufactures love to tout how many megapixels their latest greatest device has and for much of the device consuming public they think more megapixels means a better quality image.  This is only slightly true.  The main factors that increase the quality of a picture taken on any given camera are the size and quality of the light sensor that translates visible light into digital information and the quality of the optics used in the lens.  If you think I'm kidding, next time you run into a professional photographer at a wedding or other event, ask them how much their cameras cost, or better yet, ask them how much their lenses cost.  You'd probably be picking your jaw up off the floor when they told you…  My point is that these guys and gals spend big money on quality equipment to take really great pictures, and if the quality of the pictures only depended on the number of megapixels the camera had, you'd probably see them chasing the bride around the dance floor with an iPhone instead of 20lbs of camera gear.  But I digress...</p>

            <img src="public/img/tutorialImgs/techStuffWarning.png" id="techStuffWarningMega" alt="Warning! Techy stuff ahead!" />

            <p>Any who, so what the heck is a megapixel and what does it mean when a camera has more of them?  Well first off, the word pixel is short for picture element.  Think of an image as a mosaic with millions of tiny dots that each has one color.  When you put enough dots together and in the right order, you get an image.  For example, when you see the screen resolution for a computer monitor, it's listed in pixels.  My monitor's resolution is 1920x1080, meaning the image it displays is 1,920 pixels wide by 1,080 pixels tall.  Multiply those two numbers together and you get the total number of pixels in the screen.  Rounding down a bit, that means my computer screen has two million pixels in it, or two megapixels (one megapixel = one million pixels).</p> 

            <p><img src="public/img/tutorialImgs/pixelGrid.png" id="pixelGrid" alt="Pixel Grid Image" />Okay, so what does screen resolution have to do with the amount of megapixels in a camera?  Well, nothing really, but digital images are measured the same way monitors are, using pixels.  Let's say you have a 2 MP (megapixel) camera.  When you take a photograph, that photograph will have 2 MP's worth of pixels in it and depending on the camera, that image would be around 1,920px wide and 1,080px tall.  Or some other number of pixels wide and tall that multiply to two million pixels.  The take away point of all of this is that if a camera is an X number of pixel camera, then the pictures it takes will have X number of pixels in them.</p>

            <p>Alright, so what does all of this mean?  In short, it means the more megapixels your camera has, the larger the picture will physically be.  Using the previous example image, if you wanted to make a print of that image you would divide the width (1,920px) by 300 and get the physical length of the picture in inches and do the same with the height.<img src="public/img/tutorialImgs/imgMeasurement.png" id="imgMeasurement" alt="Image measurement example" />  The 300 you divide by is the number of pixels in one inch that the world of printing uses by default.  Meaning for every 1in of printed material, the digital width is 300px.  The image of the old airmail stamp on the right demonstrates this well.  If your digital image is 600px wide, when physically printed, it will be 2 inches wide.  Now, I'm not going to get into it here but sometimes printers use 200ppi, 240ppi, or some other number but the point is the more pixels your digital image has, the larger your physical print can be.  This is why some might think more megapixels increase image quality.  Because the larger the image is the more detail you can see right?  Well yeah, but as long as the image isn't blown up to be larger than it's pixel dimensions allow, the image will look just as sharp as any other image taken with a camera that has more megapixels.</p>

            <p>So, unless you're taking photos that will be blown up and used as billboards, you <strong>DO NOT</strong> need a camera with 8 quadrillion megapixels…  Instead, find a camera that has the best optics available in your price range.  For more on megapixels, cameras, and how to use them, I would recommend a book called "The Digital Photography Book" by Scott Kelby.  The book has 4 separate volumes you can purchase individually but they're really quick reads and go over a lot of the basics of digital photography that would be invaluable to anyone looking to take their own pictures for use in virtual tours.
