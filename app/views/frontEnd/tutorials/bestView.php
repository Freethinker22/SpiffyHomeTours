            <p>This tutorial will cover some the basics of touching up the photos you've taken using Adobe Photoshop CS5.  There are numerous tricks you can do to a photo to make it look better than the raw version that came out of your camera.  But for the sake of brevity I'm going to just touch on a few the most important ones.  Such as correcting color, adjusting contrast, and cropping.</p>

            <p class="notes">*Please be aware if you're using Photoshop Elements 10 some of the features I talk about aren't available in that program.</p>

            <p>One of the great things about photo editing is there are usually numerous ways to do the same thing.  That being said, the techniques I'm about to demonstrate are the way I'd do it if I was short on time but not necessarily the best way.  Photoshop has a heck of a learning curve and everyone usually develops their own methods for getting the results they want.  There are literally dozens if not hundreds of books on the market covering the use of Photoshop and other editing software so I'm not going to reinvent the wheel here.  If you're interested in learning more about Photoshop, I would highly recommend purchasing a book or two on the subject.  The two I found most useful were "The Adobe Photoshop CS4 Book for Digital Photographers" By Scott Kelby and "Adobe Photoshop Classroom In A Book" from Adobe Press.  They're both really easy step by step books and read faster than you might think.  Okay, now on to the good stuff!</p>

            <p>Take a look at the picture below.  The image itself isn't too bad and would be okay in a virtual tour but it has a few things that could use some work.  First off, the colors are a bit flat and kind of look washed out.  You want to keep the colors as close to true as possible and create the same warm inviting look as the home you're trying to sell.  After all, half the battle of selling a property is getting warm bodies in the door to look at the place and if it looks good on camera, that's more incentive for a potential buyer to come see it in person.</p>

            <img src="public/img/tutorialImgs/lgBefore.jpg" class="center" id="lgBefore" alt="Picture of a room used to demo photo editing" />

            <p class="notes">*Side note, don't use the original image when editing.  Before you open the image in PS, copy the file using copy and paste and use that image for editing.  <strong>Never</strong> edit a photo you don't have backed up!</p>

            <h2>Step 1:</h2>

            <div id="bestStepOne">
                <p>To fix the colors using PS CS5 we first need to open the image and apply what's called adjustment layers.  Open the Adjustment panel if it's not already on the screen and select "Curves".  The Adjustment panel can be found under the Window menu in the top bar.  The Curves feature is a fancy way of tweaking the contrast and tones of an image.  In Photoshop Elements, it's called Adjust Color Curves and can be found under the Adjust Colors submenu in the Enhance menu on the top bar.  Click on the arrow next to "Curves Presets" and find the preset "Medium Contrast," click on that.  Notice how the image looks less flat and has more of a difference between light and dark colors?  That's what contrast does.  If you don't like the results try and play around with the settings till you think it looks good.</p>

            </div>

            <h2>Step 2:</h2>

            <div id="bestStepTwo">
                <p>The next layer we'll want to apply is called "Levels."  The Levels layer is a way of adjusting the brightness of an image and is used to set what the colors white and black are to look like.  The Levels layer can be applied the same way as Curves and in CS5 start out by trying the Increase Contrast 1 preset and work from there depending on how it looks.  The Levels layer is available in PS Elements too.</p>
                <img src="public/img/tutorialImgs/levelsPanel.png" id="levelsPanel" alt="Image of the Levels panel in PS" />
                <p class="notes">*By the way, someone could write an entire tutorial on the subject of Curves and Levels alone and someone actually has.  Check out this <a href="http://www.cambridgeincolour.com/tutorials/photoshop-curves.htm" target="_blank">tutorial</a> for a great explanation of Photoshop's Curves and Levels.</p>
            </div>

            <h2>Step 3:</h2>

            <div id="bestStepThree">
                <p>The colors still look a bit washed out and could use a little more pop.  That's where the Vibrance layer comes in.  This layer isn't available in PS Elements so you'd have to have the full version to do this one but there are many other ways to adjust colors using that program.  In PS CS5 the Vibrance layer is located in the same place as Curves and Levels.  Click the button in the adjustment panel that looks like a V.  That will bring up a panel with two sliders on it, one for Vibrance and the other for Saturation.  In the example I have here I have the Vibrance slider set at 25%.</p>
                <img src="public/img/tutorialImgs/vibrancePanel.png" id="vibrancePanel" alt="Image of the Vibrance panel in PS" />
                <p>If you're wondering what Vibrance and Saturation do they're actually quite similar.  Increasing Saturation increases the amount of color in the image across all colors.  To put it another way, it makes all the reds more red and all the blues, greens and yellows more blue, green, and yellow respectively.  Vibrance on the other hand only increases the amount of colors in parts of the image that need it.  Meaning instead of a broad increase of all colors, it might only increase the saturation of the couch or the flowers etc.  I recommend playing around with these settings and finding what looks good but make sure not to go overboard and make the picture look like something out of the 1960s. </p>
            </div>

            <h2>Step 4:</h2>

            <p>Now, with those fixes out of the way we can move on to cropping.  Cropping pictures is done for a few different reasons.  One, to remove any unwanted object that made its way into the image, two, to fix any framing errors, such as half a door way that doesn't look good or add anything to the image, and three, enhance the composition of the image.  The first two are fairly intuitive but composition can be a bit tricky.  In short, composition is how the objects in a picture are laid out or where they are in relation to the edges of the image.  The main technique used in composition is called The Rule of Thirds.  Basically you divide the image into thirds both vertically and horizontally with imaginary lines, like a tic tac toe board, and position objects of interest on those lines and at the points where the lines intersect.  Now for some reason, well beyond my understanding, creates the most aesthetically pleasing layout to the human eye.  The lines and points are the spots the eye is naturally drawn to when viewing a picture and this is why it's important to align interesting subjects like spiffy light fixtures or a nice looking fireplace to those points.</p>

            <img src="public/img/tutorialImgs/ruleOfThirds.jpg" class="center" id="ruleOfThirds" alt="Image with rule of thirds lines drawn on it" />

            <p class="notes">*For a more in depth explanation on the subject of composition check out this <a href="http://www.cambridgeincolour.com/tutorials/rule-of-thirds.htm" target="_blank">tutorial</a> on the subject.</p>

            <p>With Photoshop, cropping out the unwanted parts and adhering to the rule of thirds is made easy by turning on the rule of thirds overlay in the cropping options.  When you use the crop tool, at the top bar there is a small drop menu labeled Crop Guide Overlay.  Select the rule of thirds option and Photoshop will automatically draw the rule lines within the cropping box.  Use those as a guide to align points of interest in your image to make it more visually appealing.</p>

            <img src="public/img/tutorialImgs/croppingImg.jpg" class="center" id="croppingImg" alt="Image with cropping tool being used" />

            <p class="notes">*Also, to make your job easier when it comes to cropping you should consider the rule of thirds when you actually taking the picture.  Some camera can draw the imaginary lines on their view screens to make it easy to line things up but if yours doesn't try and visualize where those lines would be while looking through the viewer.</p>

            <p>So now we've fixed up the colors of the image, adjusted the contrast and brightness, and finally did some strategic cropping to make the picture more pleasant to look at.  And remember there are many more ways to enhance photos with simple steps like these.  If you're going to be doing your own photography for your virtual tours I highly recommend the modest investment of time and money to learn how to make your photos look great.
