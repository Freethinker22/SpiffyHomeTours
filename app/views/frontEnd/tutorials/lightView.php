            <p>This tutorial is a collection of tips and advice on a couple different situations involved with taking real estate photography.  It'll cover some of the basics concerning the lighting of photographs as well as some information on camera settings that are involved with lighting.  The first and what I consider the most important topic I'll discuss is the shot that shows the front of the house.  This picture will be the first glimpse of the property that potential clients will see and if they're not impressed, it'll be the last one too.  I'll also cover what you'll want to do to properly light a room in the house and how to take pictures without a flash.  If you're in the market for a definitive guide to photography lighting and taking good real estate pictures in general, check out "How to take photos that move houses" by Ed Wolkis.</p>

                <p>Before I get any farther, you'll need to know that most of the tips and advice I discuss in this tutorial will use a DSLR camera with a tripod and wide angle lens.  DSLR stands for digital single lens reflex and is the most common type of "real" camera on the market.  And when I say "real" camera, I don't mean pocket sized point and shoot cameras or the camera on your phone or iPad.  You can get decent results with a point and shoot camera but for the best results you'll need a DSLR with a tripod.  I don't discuss camera choice in any of my tutorials due to the vast number of options and price points out there so make sure you do your due diligence before spending any money on one.  Okay, on to the info.</p>

            <p class="clearFloat">As I mentioned before, the first picture you'll use in your virtual tour will probably be a shot of the front of the house.  Though it's only one picture, you'll need to make sure to get the best shot possible to give the best first impression.  Now, I'll let you in on a little secret, the best time to take outdoor pictures is in what photographers refer to as the "magic hour."  The magic hour is 30 minutes before and after sunset and sunrise.  This is because when the sun is lower on the horizon, the light it produces is more diffuse and has a warmer hue to it.  During this time the shadows are much softer and the highlights are less likely to be overexposed and blown out.  It is this time of day when you want to take your outdoor photographs, whether of the front or back of the house.  Just look at the two images below.  Both are taken from the same spot but one at mid day and one during the magic hour.  Quite the difference eh?</p>

            <p><strong>(Insert image of house taken at mid day and one at the magic hour)</strong></p>

            <p class="notes">*Also, photograph the front of the house from an angle.  It's a matter of taste but I think pictures taken directly in front of the house looking straight on look boring and appear rushed.  Pictures looking at the house from a slight angle look more stylish and thought out.</p>

            <p>Before I dive into taking good interior pictures, you'll need to know some basics about how cameras work and how to use their settings.  But seeing how that topic can and has filled many a book and tutorial, I'll just move ahead on the assumption you know what an aperture is and how it works with the shutter speed to create images.  If you're new to photography I would recommend a book called "The Digital Photography Book" by Scott Kelby.  The book has 4 separate volumes you can purchase individually but they're really quick reads and go over a lot of the basics of digital photography that would be invaluable to anyone looking to take their own pictures for use in virtual tours.  For a quick but very useful overview of camera basics, check out these <a href="http://www.cambridgeincolour.com/learn-photography-concepts.htm" target="_blank">tutorials</a> too.</p>

            <p>So here is another little secret to taking good real estate photographs.  Don't use a flash!  Especially the one built into the camera.  Unless you have a full lighting rig with flash strobes and umbrellas, flashes tend to create hard shadows and uneven lighting that is very unflattering.  Now if all you have is a point and shoot camera this secret isn't of any use.  But if you're using a DSLR camera with a tripod, it's really easy to get a great photo without using a flash.</p>

            <h2>Step 1:</h2>

            <p>The first thing you'll need to do is get the room you intend to shoot lit up.  Don't worry about tungsten lighting vs. florescent lighting because one, it's a drawn out in depth explanation that two, doesn't matter too much as long as you have a decent camera and have the white balance set to auto.  Just turn on enough of the lights in the room to get it well lit and maybe crack the shades a bit too.</p>

            <h2>Step 2:</h2>

            <p>Next, get your camera set up on your tripod and find the spot you want to shoot from.  Try not to aim the camera at brightly lit exterior windows that don't have some sort of blinds or curtains on them.  If you shoot a window that has direct sun light coming through it, the window will appear blown out and mess up the picture.  Also, if the room you're shooting is really small, like a bathroom, shoot from just outside the doorway.  Be aware of mirrors too when setting up to photograph a bathroom.</p>

            <h2>Step 3:</h2>

            <div id="lightAvMode">
                <p>Put the camera in aperture priority mode, usually A or Av on the mode settings wheel.  This mode makes it so the aperture of the camera doesn't change but instead the camera calculates the best shutter speed to use with the chosen aperture.  Start off with an f-stop setting of f/8 or so.  And, if your camera has an adjustable ISO setting, make sure it's set around 100 or 200, the lower the better.</p>

            </div>

            <h2>Step 4:</h2>

            <p>Aim the camera at what you want to shoot and focus the lens.  Once you have everything setup, push the shutter button.  The camera will open the shutter for the length of time needed to properly expose the picture and will close it when done.  The length of time will vary depending on the amount of light in the room and what the aperture is set to, but will most likely be several seconds.  This is why it's <strong>VERY</strong> important to use a tripod when doing this otherwise you'll end up with really blurry photographs.</p>

            <p class="notes">*An even better method to take the picture is to get what's called a shutter release.  It's a button on a cable that plugs into your camera and allows you to take the picture without having to touch the camera and potentially shake it while the shutter is open.</p>

            <h2>Step 5:</h2>

            <p>Don't be afraid of experimenting with the aperture.  If shutter speed is ridiculously too long, say north of 15 seconds, try and use a bigger aperture.  This means reducing the number for the f-stop.  For example f/5.6 means the aperture is open wider than at f/8.  The wider the aperture, the more light is allowed in and the less time is needed to expose the image sensor.</p>

            <p>Here is a side by side comparison using a flash on the left and using the tutorial's method on the right.  Notice how much softer the shadows are in the flash-less one and how much more even the lighting is.  Like I mentioned earlier, unless you have a professional lighting setup and know how to use it, I believe this method is the best way to get great interior images for your property.
