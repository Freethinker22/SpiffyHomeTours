    <h1>About Me:</h1>
    <p>Spiffy Home Tours is a site developed, owned, and operated by me, Matt Whitehead of Lawrence, KS.  I actually used to be a real estate agent from 2005 through 2007.  I ended up getting my license about a year before the market went into the tank... Yeah, whoops!<img src="public/img/mattW.jpg" alt="Picture of Matt Whitehead" />Any who, I ended up back at my old job but I've always had the ambition to own my own business and I've been interested in web development and programming ever since I was in high school.  So after few years and a few not so great ideas later I came up with the idea to develop a virtual tour web application and build a site that sells the service to real estate agents and anyone else try to sell a home.  So for the past couple years I've been developing this website and virtual tour with the idea of making the whole process of building and using a virtual tour much easier and more simple than what is currently on the market.</p>
    <p>For a little bit more information about the tours and my company please read the section below.  For a little bit more about me, please read on.  Currently, I'm 28 years old and married to whom I consider the prettiest gal in town.  We have two wonderful cats together and an always hungry but really furry chinchilla.  I personally try and not take life too seriously; you're not going to get out alive anyway...  But I do enjoy many different activities and finding new ways to injure myself such as running, biking, and frisbee golf to name a few.  Currently I've started and finished 4 half marathons and 1 full marathon, every single one of which hurt like hell afterward but I keep going back for more...  I'm also an amateur photographer and mainly enjoy shooting landscapes and architecturally interesting buildings whenever I happen across them.  Make sure to stop by the <a href="Tutorials" title="Tutorials Page">tutorials page</a> where I share some of the tips and tricks I've picked up about taking great interior and exterior photographs of homes and buildings. (mention that I'm a self taught developer)</p>
    <h1>About the Product:</h1>
    <p>Under development for the past two years and designed from the ground up to be intuitive, easy to use, and good looking while doing so.  The tours feature all of the standard virtual tour bells and whistles plus much more!  A Spiffy Home Tour is much more than just a slideshow of images set to music.  With one of my tours you can create an interactive web application.  This is made possible by giving you, the subscriber, the option to add hotspots to your tours during the tour building process.  You have the choice of three interactive buttons you can add to your images.  Drop down info boxes to help explain a feature of a property, pop open detail pictures that allow you to add a close up of a certain part of the home, and navigation buttons which allow the user to navigate through the property without needing to scroll through a menu to find the next room over.  To see some examples of these features in action, be sure to click over to the <a href="Samples" title="Samples Page">samples page</a> and check out how the tours work.</p>
    <p>As mentioned earlier those features can be added to the tour during the tour building process.  The process itself is almost a step by step tutorial with step numbers and pop up help boxes that guide you along the way.  The tours themselves are Flash based and require the Adobe Flash player to run in the user's web browser.  Though this is really not a problem, seeing as almost 90+ percent of home computers these days already have the Flash plug-in.  Future version of the tour which are already on the drawing board will most likely not be Flash based as web moves away from this technology over the next number of years.</p>
