            <p>Like the heading says, this page discusses some of the tips and tricks I've picked up along the way as an amateur photographer.  Although hiring a professional photographer would get you the best pictures, the cost and time of doing so might not be on your side.  Because of this I've put together several simple tutorials to help out if you decide to take your own.  I don't cover any advanced photo taking techniques but I do touch on some basic methods to help with your real estate photography.  Throughout the tutorials I've also included links to many other tutorials not on this site and recommendations for books that I found handy when I was learning the art of photo taking.  Please feel free to contact me with any questions you might have or if you have an idea for a new tutorial.</p>

            <p class="notes">*For the sake of full discloser, I have no affiliation, nor do I receive any money from the makers of the products I talk about in these tutorials.  If the makers of those products are reading this and would like to pay me money for mentioning them, please navigate to my <a href="Contact" title="Contact me">contact</a> page…</p>

            <p><img src="public/img/tutorialImgs/onlyImg.png" id="onlyImg" alt="Only graphic" />Any who, the main software program I use in my photography and demonstrate in these tutorials is Adobe Photoshop CS5.  Now, you might be wondering how much Photoshop costs, well… for the latest full version, it's around $700, and that's for the base version, the extended one costs even more.  But!  Unless you doing photo shoots for National Geographic or you're just a sucker for fancy software like me, there is no need to go out and drop that much money.  Enter, the bargain version, Photoshop Elements 10.  Elements is a toned down version but still has many of the same great photo editing features of its bigger more fancy brother.  AND! It's only $100.  You can also download a fully functional trial and give it a go before shelling out your hard earned money.  For more info, visit the <a href="http://www.adobe.com/products/photoshop-elements.html" target="_blank">Photoshop Elements</a> page on Adobe's website.  If you're looking to save some money but still want to edit your photos try looking into Google's free image editing software called <a href="http://picasa.google.com" target="_blank">Picasa</a>.</p>
