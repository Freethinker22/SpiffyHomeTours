            <!--<p>***Somewhere on this site or maybe this main page, I need to explain the process of how simple it is to build a tour with Spiffy home tours?  Something like "All you'll need to get stated is a picture of yourself and your information" Or, "All you need to build a virtual tour is the pictures from the property and some basic info on the house?"  Either way I need to talk about how the site is setup and the tours are built.***</p>
            <p>Explain simple step by step process and use an image of the steps in the tour building process.  Talk about tour management panel and have a picture of that too.  Wait till whole site is done then rebuild home page?</p>
            <p>Unique Selling Proposition: Talk about my low prices and amortization calculator.  Promote what I don't different and or better!</p>-->
